## IDEAS

### Encryption
We can encrypt the password in multiple different parts of the program. If we're evil, we can encrypt different parts of the password with using different encryption algorithms or keys.

### Bloating
We can write scripts to replace certain instructions with bloated equivalents automatically.

### Control flow manipulation 
We can also use scripts to arbitrarily add random functions, function calls and garbage code throughout the assembly that manipulates control flow but does not affect the execution of the program.
